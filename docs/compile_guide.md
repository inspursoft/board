## Introduction

There are dev method and release method to build and run Board. This guide provides instructions for developers to build and run Board by dev method. 


## Step 1: Prepare for a build environment for Board

Board is deployed as several Docker containers and most of the code is written in Go language. The build environment requires Python, Docker, Docker Compose and golang development environment. Please install the below prerequisites:


Software              | Required Version
----------------------|--------------------------
docker-ce             | 17.03 +
docker-compose        | 1.14.0 +
python                | 2.7 +
git                   | 1.8.3 +
make                  | 3.81 +
golang                | 1.9.6 +


## Step 2: Getting the source code

   ```sh
      $ git clone http://10.110.18.40:10080/inspursoft/board.git
   ```


## Step 3: Building and installing Board

### Configuration

Edit the file **make/board.cfg** and make necessary configuration changes such as hostname, admin password ,mysql server and so on. Refer to **[Installation and Configuration Guide](installation_guide.md#configuring-board)** for more info.

   ```sh
      $ cd board
      $ vi make/board.cfg
   ```

### Compiling and Running in development

You can compile and running by the approache:

#### I. Prepare configuration and env 

   ```sh
      $ make prepare
   ```

#### Ⅱ. Compile UI  

   ```sh
      $ make compile_ui
   ```
   
#### Ⅲ. Building and Running Board

   ```sh
      $ make -e DEVFLAG=dev start
   ```

## Step 4: Verify the Board

Refer to [View and test Board REST API via Swagger](configure_swagger.md) for testing the Board REST API.


## Step 5: Stop Board Instance

When you want to stop Board instance, run:

   ```sh
      $ make -e DEVFLAG=dev down
   ```


## Appendix
* Using the Makefile

The `Makefile` contains predefined targets:

Target                           | Description

   **Note**: IMG's value is one of apiserver, tokenserver, log, collector, gitserver, jenkins, mysql and nginx. PACKAGE's value is one of apiserver, tokenserver and collector/cmd. 


#### EXAMPLE:


#### Compile apiserver,tokenserver and collector/cmd binary 

   ```sh
      $ make install
   ```
   
#### Build apiserver image

   ```sh
      $ make container/apiserver_build 
   ```

#### Clean apiserver image

   ```sh
      $ make container/apiserver_rmi 
   ```

#### Formats apiserver source files

   ```sh
      $ make src/apiserver_fmt 
   ```

#### Examines apiserver source code and reports suspicious constructs

   ```sh
      $ make src/apiserver_vet 
   ```

#### Linter for apiserver source code

   ```sh
      $ make src/apiserver_golint
   ```

#### Compile apiserver binary

   ```sh
      $ make src/apiserver_install
   ```

#### Check apiserver source file by fmt vet golint and compile

   ```sh
      $ make src/apiserver_compile 
   ```
