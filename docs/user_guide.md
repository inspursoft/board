## User account
Board supports databse authentication modes and support LDAP mode:  

* **Database(db_auth)**  

	Users are stored in the local database.  
	
	A user can register himself/herself in Board in this mode. To disable user self-registration, refer to the [installation guide](installation_guide.md) for initial configuration, or disable this feature in [Administrator Options](#administrator-options). When self-registration is disabled, the system administrator can add users into Board. 
	
	When registering or adding a new user, the username and email must be unique in the Board system. The password must contain at least 8 characters with 1 lowercase letter, 1 uppercase letter and 1 numeric character.  
	
* **LDAP/Active Directory (ldap_auth)**  

	Under this authentication mode, users whose credentials are stored in an external LDAP or AD server can log in to Board directly.  
	
	When an LDAP/AD user logs in by *username* and *password*, Board binds to the LDAP/AD server with the **"LDAP Search DN"** and **"LDAP Search Password"** described in [installation guide](installation_guide.md). If it succeeded, Board looks up the user under the LDAP entry **"LDAP Base DN"** including substree. The attribute (such as uid, cn) specified by **"LDAP UID"** is used to match a user with the *username*. If a match is found, the user's *password* is verified by a bind request to the LDAP/AD server.  
	
	Self-registration, changing password and resetting password are not supported under LDAP/AD authentication mode because the users are managed by LDAP or AD.  

* **User password find back**  	

    User can find back the password by email:
	
	Click the "forgot password" in the login page:
	<img src="img/userguide/password1.JPG" width="100" alt="pass1">
	
	Input the user name or the registered email account:
	<img src="img/userguide/password2.JPG" width="100" alt="pass2">
	<img src="img/userguide/password3.JPG" width="100" alt="pass2">
	
	Click send request:
	<img src="img/userguide/password4.JPG" width="100" alt="pass4">
	
	User will receive an email to reset password in the registered email account
	<img src="img/userguide/password5.JPG" width="100" alt="pass5">
	
## Project Based Access Control  

Board manages services through projects on container service platform. Users can be added into system as a member with different roles:  

* **Anonymous**: When a user is not logged in, the user is considered as an "Anonymous" user. An anonymous user has no access to private projects and has read-only access to public projects and services.  
* **Registry User**: When a user logs in, the user will have the authority to create a new project or be pulled into an existing project.
* *** ProjectAdmin ***: When creating a new project, the user will be assigned the "ProjectAdmin" role in new project. The "ProjectAdmin" can invite users join the project  which created by himself.
* *** ProjectMember ***: When invited in to one exist project, the user will be assigned the "ProjectMember" role in new project. The "ProjectMember" can create and delete the service in the project but can not delete the project. One user isn't a member of one project, can't create or delete service in this project, can't access it's private service.
* **SysAdmin**: "SysAdmin" has the most privileges. In addition to the privileges mentioned above, "SysAdmin" can also list all projects, set an ordinary user as administrator, delete users. The public project "library" is also owned by the administrator.  


## Manage Projects
A project in Board contains all services, images etc., There are two types of projects in Board:

* **Public**: All users have the read privilege to a public project, it's convenient for you to share some services or others in this way.

* **Private**: A private project can only be accessed by users with proper privileges.

You can create a project after you signed in. Check on the "Public/Private" checkbox will make this project public.
